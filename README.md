# 🔐 Smart Password Manager

A secure **Python-based password manager** that allows users to store, retrieve, generate, and manage passwords safely using a **master password**.  
The project supports both a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with Tkinter.

All credentials are **encrypted at rest** using a key derived from the master password.
